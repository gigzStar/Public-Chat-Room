# Public-Chat-Room
Open Project

sign in if you after creating account

BUT!!!

install Xampp
 make sure in Xampp control, both Apache and SQL are running (turns to green color)

DON'T FORGET TO CREATE A DATABASE NAMING "chatme" AND IMPORT THE SQL FILE AND RUN.
WITHOUT THE DATABASE THE PROJECT WON'T RUN.

------Thank you-------
